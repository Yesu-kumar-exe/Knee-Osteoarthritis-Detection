# Knee Osteoarthritis Detection Using Deep Learning

This project predicts the stages of Knee Osteoarthritis using medical images and a CNN-based deep learning model.

## Project Description
The system classifies knee X-ray images into four stages:
- Healthy
- Mild
- Moderate
- Severe

A CNN model is trained using image preprocessing, feature extraction, and classification techniques.

## Technologies Used
- Python
- Deep Learning
- Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN)
- OpenCV
- NumPy
- Keras
- Tkinter
- Machine Learning

## Features
- Dataset upload and preprocessing
- CNN model training and testing
- Accuracy, Precision, Recall, and F1-score calculation
- Confusion matrix visualization
- GUI-based prediction using Tkinter

## How to Run
1. Install required libraries
2. Run `project.py`
3. Upload dataset
4. Train the model
5. Predict knee osteoarthritis stage
